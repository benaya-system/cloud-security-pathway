# Cloud Security Pathway (AWS) — Study Log

Goal: Become job-ready for Cloud Security / DevSecOps focused on AWS, with a public portfolio.

## Study routine
- 3 hours/day, 6 days/week (no study from Friday sunset to Saturday sunset).
- Every week: at least 1 public deliverable (doc/script) on GitHub.

## What I'm building
1) Foundations: Linux, networking, Git
2) Python security automation
3) AWS security labs (IAM, VPC, logging, monitoring)
4) Portfolio projects with documentation (threat model, incident reports)

## Repo structure
- /docs: decisions, study rules, incident reports
- /linux-labs: command notes + hardening
- /networking: HTTP/DNS/TLS labs
- /git-workflow: workflow notes
- /python-security-automation: scripts + tests
- /aws-security-labs: IAM, CloudTrail, VPC, Flow Logs, CloudWatch

## Rules
- If it's not documented, it doesn't exist.
- No secrets in this repo (keys/tokens).
